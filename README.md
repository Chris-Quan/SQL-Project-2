# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
Given various CSV files, I will load them and organize them into a database using SQL to gather and derive useful information

## Process
1. Load all the spread sheets
2. clean up the data
3. Answer the questions via queries
4. create and answer my own questions via queries
5. Create an ERD
6. discuss how I would do QA to improve everything

## Results
